# GeoHub

## What is GeoHub?

GeoHub is my own version of the popular geography guessing game: Geoguessr.

For those unfamilar with Geoguessr, it uses Google Streetview to place you in a random location and you have to guess where you think you are in the world. You can move around and use clues around you such as Language, Architecture, Road Signs, etc... to make your guess. The objective is clear, the closer you are to the correct location, the more points you get.

## How do I play?

Go to the website: [GeoHub](https://geohub.vercel.app) and create an account, it is free and takes 15 seconds. If you don't want to create your own account, you can login to the guest account using the credentials below:

Once you have an account, you are ready to play! You can click play on any of the offical maps on the home page such as:

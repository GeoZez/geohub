# GeoHub

A web application with several geography games. The main game mode is based on the popular game Geoguessr. For those who have not played Geoguessr, it uses google streetview to place you in a random location in the world and you can move around using context clues to guess where you are in the world. The closer you are to the correct location, the higher your score. Unfortunately, Google recently increased their maps API costs which resulted in Geoguessr making the game paid. This along with my love for geography, inspired me to make my own version where I could play for free. 

I do hope that I can host the site in the future using the free Google Maps plan, but for now if you want to play you can clone this repo, plug in your google maps API and play locally.
